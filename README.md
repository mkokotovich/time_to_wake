# time_to_wake
A clock for toddlers that glows yellow while it's still time to sleep, but then turns green when it's time to wake

Uses ESP8266 and a couple libraries to create a clock that can be programmed from a web-ui. 

Either manually turn the clock yellow, green, or off, or set a timer to do it automatically.
